# Project 1 

![Portfolio Analysis](images/project1.png)

## Project Summary




A relationship between Bitcoin (BTC) price and the major US stock market indexes: S&P500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq composite, for the year of covid: 2020.

## Details
There is a theory that the price of bitcoin should have increased due to the pandemic, but instead it has shown that it is tied to how well other financial markets are doing.  There is also some trends where bitcoin has deviated from this as well. 

It will be interesting to see any correlations and covariances.  


I shall look at stock data and trends with data trends of BTC prices

## Questions to ask are

- When the stock/financial market is high, is bitcoin price more?
- When does bitcoin start to fall in price compared to the other financial markets
    - How does the price of physical gold compare to bitcoin pricing and other financial markets 

If and where there is a difference, I shall try and graph why there is a difference between them.  

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.


 - Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s).


 - Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.


 - Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis.


 Use PyViz, Panel, Plotly Express, and Hvplot to create six to eight visualizations of your data (ideally, at least two per question you ask of your data), and then aggregate these visualizations into a dashboard.


 Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.


 Use one new Python library that hasn't been covered in class.


 Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions.


 Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each question you asked of your data and under each heading a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
